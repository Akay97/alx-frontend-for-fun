# Accessibility Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on web accessibility, aiming to make websites more inclusive and accessible for users with disabilities. The goal is to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and learn best practices for creating accessible HTML and CSS. This includes understanding ARIA, using assistive technologies, and improving color contrast, navigation, and interaction for a more inclusive web experience.

## Concepts Covered
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: Understanding its main purpose and how to implement it for dynamic content and user interaction.
- **WCAG Conformance Levels**: Understanding levels A, AA, and AAA to meet accessibility standards effectively.
- **Importance of Web Accessibility**: Learning why accessibility matters for all users and complying with legal and ethical standards.
- **Tools for Web Accessibility**: Familiarizing with tools for testing accessibility, such as screen readers, color contrast checkers, and browser developer tools.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. **Explain ARIA’s Purpose**: Understand how ARIA helps improve accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
2. **Identify WCAG Conformance Levels**: Differentiate between WCAG levels A, AA, and AAA, and explain their significance.
3. **Recognize the Importance of Web Accessibility**: Understand how accessible design benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.
4. **Use Accessibility Tools**: Gain familiarity with tools like screen readers, contrast checkers, and accessibility checkers for testing web content.

## Project Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Browser Compatibility**: HTML and CSS rendered on Chrome 78 or later.
- **Mandatory File**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory.

## Task Summary
The project tasks focus on:
1. Creating accessible HTML and CSS.
2. Implementing ARIA roles and properties where needed.
3. Testing web pages with various accessibility tools.
4. Ensuring color contrast and keyboard navigability.

## Tools & Testing
- **Screen Readers**: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Accessibility Testing Tools**: Axe, WAVE, Lighthouse
- **Color Contrast Checkers**: WebAIM Contrast Checker, Contrast Ratio
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Chrome DevTools Accessibility Panel

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a web page that meets WCAG AA standards, ensuring all users can access, navigate, and understand the content. By incorporating accessible design practices, the project highlights the importance of inclusivity in web development.
